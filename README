Standard In: Basic plugin to store keys pressed and provide a callback with the string of characters.

Designed to support barcode readers for kiosks, 

Example:

$(document).stdin(function (string) {
  alert("You entered the following: '" + string + "'");
}, {timeout: 1000});

After a second delay it will alert the characters entered.

Options:
timeout: millisecond delay
stopChar: array of characters that will trigger the callback.  Most barcode scanners end with either a tab or newline.
